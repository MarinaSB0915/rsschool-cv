####About me
I am a computer science and mathematics teacher in college. I also teach applied computer science, where we study Autodesk Fusion and Inventor programs.
I am constantly learning. The moment of change has come in my life. I like teaching, but I don't like being constantly responsible for the actions of others. I decided to study frontend development.

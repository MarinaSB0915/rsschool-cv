####About me
I am a computer science and mathematics teacher in college. I also teach applied computer science, where we study Autodesk Fusion and Inventor programs.
I am constantly learning. The moment of change has come in my life. I like teaching, but I don't like being constantly responsible for the actions of others. I decided to study frontend development.
####Skills

- CSS
- JavaScript (Basic)
- Git/GitHub

- Adobe Photoshop
- SketchUp, Autodesk Fusion 360

####Code example

} else if (month <= 9) {
return 3
} else if (month <= 12) {
return 4
}
}
```
